# Java Control Flow Practice

This repository contains a collection of Java programs focused on practicing and mastering **control flow statements**. Each program demonstrates the use of essential control structures such as:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do-while` loops
- `switch` statements

## üöÄ What's Inside?

- Java programs solving a variety of logic-based problems
- Clean and readable code with comments for better understanding
- Use of different control flow constructs in practical scenarios
- Handling of user input, menu-driven logic, and edge cases

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17 or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code (any Java-compatible IDE)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## üí° Concepts Covered

- Basic to advanced loop usage
- Nested loops and pattern printing
- Menu-driven programs using `do-while` and `switch`
- Input validation and condition handling
- Use of `break` and `continue` statements

## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/control-flow-practice.git
2.Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3.Run any Java file individually and test with different inputs.
